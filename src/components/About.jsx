                        I'm an undergraduate Computer Science student at IPB University with passion in web development.
                        Right now, I’m diving into fullstack development — learning how to bring ideas to life from front-end to back-end.
                        I love exploring new tools, building projects, and challenging myself to create web experiences that are both functional and engaging.
